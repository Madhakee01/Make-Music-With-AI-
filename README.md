# Make-Music-With-AI-
A web app that generates melodies using Magentaâ€™s AI

I will be creating a web app that will display music notation system using VexFlow and Tone.js to hear the notes in a browser. I will be using an artificial intelligence package Manjenta.js to generate melodies. 

PS: Majenta.js by Google that generates melody using MusicRNN
